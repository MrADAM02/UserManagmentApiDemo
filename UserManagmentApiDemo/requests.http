Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com"
}

### Update an existing user
PUT http://localhost:5211/users/1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Jane Smith",

# Scaffolded CRUD Endpoints: Copilot generated boilerplate code for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints, ensuring RESTful API design.
# Model Creation: Suggested a simple User model for consistent data handling.
# Error Handling: Included checks for missing users, returning appropriate HTTP status codes (404 Not Found, 201 Created, 204 No Content).
# Code Consistency: Ensured endpoint naming and routing followed ASP.NET Core conventions.
# Rapid Prototyping: Enabled quick setup and iteration, reducing manual coding effort and minimizing errors.

# Validation of User Input
# Copilot recommended using [Required] and [EmailAddress] attributes in the User model and checking ModelState.IsValid in controller actions. This ensures users cannot be added with missing or invalid data, preventing issues like empty names or malformed emails.

# 2. Error Handling
# Copilot suggested wrapping controller logic in try-catch blocks. This prevents the API from crashing due to unhandled exceptions and returns meaningful error messages (500 Internal Server Error) to clients, improving reliability.

# 3. Handling Non-Existent Users
# Copilot identified the need to check for missing users in GET, PUT, and DELETE endpoints, returning 404 Not Found when a user does not exist. This provides clear feedback and avoids null reference errors.

# 4. Consistent API Design
# Copilot ensured endpoint naming and routing followed ASP.NET Core conventions, making the API predictable and easier to consume.

# 5. Rapid Debugging and Prototyping
# Copilotâ€™s code suggestions enabled quick identification and resolution of bugs, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors. This accelerated the development and debugging process.
